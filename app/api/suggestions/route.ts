CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALL questions must be formatted as questions the USER would ask the chatbot. They should be phrased as if the user is speaking to the chatbot.
2. PRIORITY: The FIRST 2-3 questions MUST be directly related to the user's most recent question and/or the recommendations they just received. These should be follow-up questions that explore:
   - More details about the recommended cards
   - Alternative options similar to what was recommended
   - Related features or benefits mentioned in the recommendations
   - Comparisons or clarifications about the recommended cards
3. The remaining questions (3rd-4th) should explore DIFFERENT aspects/topics that are still relevant but more diverse:
   - Different spending categories (travel, groceries, gas, dining, etc.)
   - Different card features (rewards, fees, benefits, insurance, etc.)
   - Different use cases (everyday spending, travel, business, building credit, etc.)
   - Different card types (cash back, points, travel, premium, starter, etc.)
4. EACH question must be DISTINCT - avoid similar or overlapping questions

Return JSON with this exact format:
{
  "suggestions": [
    "Question 1 (related to recent query/results)",
    "Question 2 (related to recent query/results)",
    "Question 3 (related to recent query/results OR diverse)",
    "Question 4 (diverse, different topic)"
  ]
}

EXAMPLES:
If user asked about travel cards and got recommendations:
- "Which of these cards has the best travel insurance?" (related to results)
- "Are there any travel cards with no foreign transaction fees?" (related to query)
- "What other travel benefits do these cards offer?" (related to results)
- "Show me cards with the best cash back for groceries" (diverse - different category)

BAD EXAMPLES (too similar - DO NOT USE):
- "What cards offer cash back for groceries?"
- "What cards offer cash back for gas?" (too similar to above)
- "Show me cards with cash back" (too similar)

INCORRECT Examples (questions for the user - DO NOT USE):
- "What is your budget?"
- "Do you travel often?"
- "How much do you spend monthly?"
- "What are your spending habits?"
- "Are you looking for cash back or points?"

Guidelines:
- Generate exactly 4 questions
- FIRST 2-3 questions MUST relate to the recent query and/or recommendations
- Remaining questions should be diverse and cover different topics
- ALL questions must be what the USER would ask the chatbot
- Start with question words (What, Which, Show me, I need, etc.)
- Keep questions concise (10 words or less, maximum 58 characters)
- Make them natural and conversational
- Ensure maximum diversity - avoid questions that are just slight variations of each other`,

CRITICAL: The FIRST 2-3 questions MUST be directly related to the user's question above and/or the recommended cards. These should be follow-up questions exploring more details, alternatives, or related features.

The remaining questions should be diverse and cover different topics (different spending categories, features, use cases, or card types).
